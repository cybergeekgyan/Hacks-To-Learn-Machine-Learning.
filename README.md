# Top-Hacks-To-Learn-Machine-Learning.

## Machine Learning journey from scratch to doing real-world projects.

Before revealing the real hacks to learn about Machine Learning. 
I would like to give you a keynote that these hacks are applicable forthose people who are going to put efforts properly in a decent manner.

### Hack 1:

If you want to build any Machine Learning model you need to communicate with a computer. this communication is done with the help of programming languages. 
There are many programming languages are out there to implement Machine Learning models. but the most popular and highly recommended one is **PYTHON**.

First Hack is that you need to learn python in a pretty decent manner. 
Hey, but hold on a moment learning python is it a Hack? your thinking is correct but I want to tell something that most of the beginners will do a common mistake is that they pick python programming and they start learning all the unnecessary topics *(Django, Flask, Tkinter etc…)* which are not useful for the Machine Learning engineers.

#### Main topics that should be mandatory for every beginner to move forward into the Machine Learning journey are:
* Getting familiar with python syntax and environment.
* Variables.
* Conditional statements.
* Loops.
* Built-in Data Structures in python (Lists,tuples,sets,Dictionaries).
* Functions.
* Modularization
* File Handling.
* Object-Oriented Programming

*After learning all the above topics you need to get your hands dirty with some third party libraries in python. which are useful in your Machine Learning Journey.
* Numpy.
* Pandas
* Requests
* BS4
* Matplotlib

*At this stage, you are good to go with dealing of high-level python modules for Machine Learning like
* Scikit Learn.
* Tensorflow
But wait for a moment Machine Learning is all about building a model with the help of Mathematical concepts. but when did you learn all those concepts? here comes your second hack.


### Hack 2:

The second Hack is about learning Mathematical Concepts.

If you want your Machine Learning journey more fruitful and interesting. then you should definitely need to be familiar with mathematical concepts. but don’t worry you don’t need to be mastering it.

*The Mathematical areas that are to be covered to understand Machine Learning Models are:
* Linear Algebra.
* Calculus.
* Probability and Statistics.
* Linear Algebra:

*The topics we need to focus on linear algebra are:
* Matrices
* Vectors
* Scalars
* Tensors
* Calculus:

*The Concepts that need to focus on Calculus are:
* Definite Integrals
* Indefinite Integrals
* Differential Calculus.
* Probability And Statistics:

*The Concepts that need to focus on Probability and Statistics are:
* Basics of Probability.
* Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Variance etc..
* Testing of Hypothesis.

If you are good at all the above topics. you feel easy while learning Machine Learning Algorithms.
In the entire Machine Learning journey, the main important aspect is about understanding the mathematics that will help you to understand the models or algorithms.
After getting a good amount of knowledge on programming and Mathematics, here comes the most important and interesting part of the Machine Learning journey.
