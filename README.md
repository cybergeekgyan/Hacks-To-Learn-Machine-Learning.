# Top-Hacks-To-Learn-Machine-Learning.

## Machine Learning journey from scratch to doing real-world projects.

Before revealing the real hacks to learn about Machine Learning. 
I would like to give you a keynote that these hacks are applicable forthose people who are going to put efforts properly in a decent manner.

### Hack 1:

If you want to build any Machine Learning model you need to communicate with a computer. this communication is done with the help of programming languages. 
There are many programming languages are out there to implement Machine Learning models. but the most popular and highly recommended one is **PYTHON**.

The first Hack is that you need to learn python in a pretty decent manner. Hey, but hold on a moment learning python is it a Hack? your thinking is correct but I want to tell something that most of the beginners will do a common mistake is that they pick python programming and they start learning all the unnecessary topics (Django, Flask, Tkinter etcâ€¦)which are not useful for the Machine Learning engineers.
The main topics that should be mandatory for every beginner to move forward into the Machine Learning journey are:
Getting familiar with python syntax and environment.
Variables.
Conditional statements.
Loops.
Built-in Data Structures in python (Lists,tuples,sets,Dictionaries).
Functions.
Modularization
File Handling.
Object-Oriented Programming
After learning all the above topics you need to get your hands dirty with some third party libraries in python. which are useful in your Machine Learning Journey.
Numpy.
Pandas
Requests
BS4
Matplotlib
At this stage, you are good to go with dealing of high-level python modules for Machine Learning like
Scikit Learn.
Tensorflow
But wait for a moment Machine Learning is all about building a model with the help of Mathematical concepts. but when did you learn all those concepts? here comes your second hack.
